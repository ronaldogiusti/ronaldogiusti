Don't get me wrong. Most of the code I write is in private repos outside GitHub.

I just wanted to try [Anurag Hazra](https://github.com/anuraghazra/anuraghazra) nice tool for github stats :smile:

[![Anurag's github stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=ronaldogiusti)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)
